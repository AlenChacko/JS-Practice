//Must begin with a letter, _, or $
let company = "Techno";
let _name = "Alen";
let $age = 26;

//Cannot start with a number
// let 2name = 'Albin'

//Case-sensitive (name â‰  Name)
let student = "Alen"; //
let Student = "Amal"; //   Both are different variables
console.log(`${student}\n${Student}`);

//Cannot use reserved keywords like let, var, function, etc.

// let function = 'test'
